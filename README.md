Analysing the Boston AirBNB data for the Udacity Project. 

## Libraries Used:

## Project Motivation
I have never analysed AirBNB data before, and wanted to learn about what it looks like and how it is informative. I was also interested in this dataset, because I am a user of AirBNB and therefore feel as if I have a connection with it.
