# Boston_AirBNB_project_udacity
Analysing the Boston AirBNB data for the Udacity Project. 

## Libraries Used:
> 1. Numpy 
> 2. Pandas 
> 3. Matplotlib pyplot
> 4. Seaborn

## Project Motivation
I have never analysed AirBNB data before, and wanted to learn about what it looks like and how it is informative. I was also interested in this dataset, because I am a user of AirBNB and therefore feel as if I have a connection with it. 

## Files:
1. Calendar.csv ~ This file contains information about the date the booking was made. 
2. Listings.csv ~ This file contains user information as well as information about the AirBNB (such as where it is located, the price, user ratings, etc). 
3. Reviews.csv ~ This file contains information about the reviews, who made it, when it was made, the comments left with the review. 

## Summary of Results:
1. Highest price for AirBNB was 4000 dollars. The majority of AirBNBs were less than or equal to 200 dollars.
2. Mattapan was the cheapest area, whereas South Boston Waterfront had the more expensive AirBNBs.
3. Expensive AirBNBs have high ratings, however the AirBNBs don't need to be expensive to have a high rating.

## Blog Post:
This is the blog Post I created about my findings of this dataset.
